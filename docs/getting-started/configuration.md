# Configuration

## Plugins À La Carte

By going to the `Edit -> Plugins` you can configure what parts of the **NEXUS** Framework are loaded.

![Plugins Window](configuration-plugins-window.png)

### NEXUS

A full list of the available plugins in the **NEXUS** Framework, with only [NEXUS: Core](/docs/category/core/) being enabled by default. This pattern enables users to selectively utilize only what they need for their project, minimizing any additional overhead that plugins may cause.

### NEXUS Samples

For many plugins, there is a counterpart plugin that houses sample content. They’re broken out into individuals to allow for fine-grain control of inclusion into your project. Additionally, there is a [TestProject](/docs/getting-started/test-project/) at the root of the repository, which serves as a showcase project for all the plugins and hosts all our functional tests

## Editor Preferences

Depending on the plugin, corresponding entries will appear in the **NEXUS** section of the **Editor Preferences**.
