# Introduction

The **NEXUS** Framework aims to help game developers ship amazing content built on top of the Unreal Engine.

## Documentation

The documentation process of the library is ultimately a never-ending process. We are **not** technical writers and are doing this by the seat of our pants. So *feedback* is critical to ensure the documentation is developed in a way that is helpful to developers.

### Examples

Examples spread throughout the documentation are presented in a two-tab format, with a **Blueprint** example being visible first. Native **C++** will always be more performant, but for the sake of argument, the most likely person to be reading this documentation will be someone looking to reference example Blueprints; thus, it gets first-up status. 

### Iconography

We've kept similar iconography to what you would expect to see in Unreal Engine when it comes to listing types in the documentation menu. However, if a custom icon is present for a particular type, that will be present when you drill down to that specific type's article/page.
