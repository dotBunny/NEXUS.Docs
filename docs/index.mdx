# Introduction

The **NEXUS** Framework aims to help you ship amazing games built on top of Unreal Engine.

## Plugins

We do our best to keep the framework split up into bespoke functional plugins. Allowing for developer agency when it comes to choosing what they want to enable/use.

### Systems

Bespoke `UWorldSubsystem`-based systems that have a specific, described functionality.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusActorPools" link={true} />
<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusDynamicReferences" link={true} />

### Helpers

Utility-like collections of functionality which haven't yet grown to system-like status but are equally helpful.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusPicker" link={true} />
<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusMultiplayer" link={true} />

### Content

While **NEXUS** is predominantly about providing code-based solutions to problems, there is still room for some opinionated content.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusUserInterface" link={true} />

### Editor-Only

Stuff that should never find its way into any cook â€” *ever*.
