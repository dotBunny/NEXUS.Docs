![NPicker](picker-samples.webp)


The `DEMO_NPicker` sample map is available once you have enabled the `NEXUS Samples: Picker` plugin. This is found in the `NEXUS Samples` category in the `Edit > Plugins` window.

The map shows at runtime all of the different distributions available through the different picking methods.
