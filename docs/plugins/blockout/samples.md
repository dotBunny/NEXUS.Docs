The `DEMO_NBlockout` sample map is available once you have enabled the `NEXUS Samples: Blockout` plugin. This is found in the `NEXUS Samples` category in the `Edit > Plugins` window.

The map is a great place to see usage of all of the materials included in the the [NEXUS: Blockout](/docs/plugins/blockout/).
