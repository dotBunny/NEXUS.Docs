<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusDynamicReferences" />

This plugin functions very much like a **service locator pattern** for `AActors` with some benefits:

- **Decoupling**: Removes hard dependencies between `AActors`
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove `AActors` from reference groups at runtime
- **Scalability**: Can handle many `AActors` of the same type without performance issues
- **Blueprint Integration**: Fully accessible from Blueprint for designers

Utilzing this pattern allows for developers to reference collections of typed objects safely without actually knowing at author-time.
