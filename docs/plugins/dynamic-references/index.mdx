# Dynamic References

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusDynamicReferences" />

This plugin functions in a **service locator pattern** for `AActors` with some benefits:

- **Decoupling**: Removes hard dependencies between `AActors`.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove `AActors` from reference groups at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Can handle many `AActors` of the same type without performance issues.
- **Blueprint Integration**: Fully accessible from Blueprint for designers. 

Utilzing this pattern allows for developers to reference collections of typed objects safely without any direct knowledge of them at author-time.
