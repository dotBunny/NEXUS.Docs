# Dynamic References

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusDynamicRefs" />

This plugin functions in a **service locator pattern** for `AActors` with some benefits:

- **Decoupling**: Removes hard dependencies between `AActors`.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove `AActors` from reference groups at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Can handle many `AActors` of the same type without performance issues.
- **Blueprint Integration**: Fully accessible from Blueprint for designers. 

Utilzing this pattern allows for developers to reference collections of typed objects safely without any direct knowledge of them at author-time.


## Add Component

Add a [UNDynamicRefComponnet](types/dynamic-ref-component.md) to an `AActor` (*most likely your doing this on a `Blueprint`*), and assign it's References from the details inspector.

## Getting Actor References

Accessing the [UNDynamicRefSubsystem](types/dynamic-ref-subsystem.md#getting-actors), referenced `AActors` can be queried.

## Samples

The `DEMO_NDynamicRefs` sample map is available once you have enabled the `NEXUS Samples: Dynamic References` plugin. This is found in the `NEXUS Samples` category in the `Edit > Plugins` window.

The map has a singular example showcasing the [UNDynamicRefComponent](types/dynamic-ref-component.md) and its various uses. The level blueprint demonstrates how to access an `AActor` by it's `ENDynamicRef`.
