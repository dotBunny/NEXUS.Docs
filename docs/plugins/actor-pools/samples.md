The `DEMO_NActorPools` sample map is available once you have enabled the `NEXUS Samples: Actor Pools` plugin. This is found in the `NEXUS Samples` category in the `Edit > Plugins` window.

The map has a variety of demonstration content, showcasing the `UNActorPoolSpawnerComponent` and its various uses. The level blueprint also demonstrates how to apply an `UNActorPoolSet` to prewarm some `FNActorPool`s.
