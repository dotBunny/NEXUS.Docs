# Overview

<PluginDetails icon="/assets/images/plugins/actor-pools/actor-pools-icon.webp" iconAlt="NActorPools" initialVersion="0.1.0" />

This plugin is purpose-built for scenarios with high-frequency `AActor` reusage:

- **Combat Systems:** Bullets, projectiles, explosions, damage numbers, etc.
- **Gameplay Objects:** Collectible items, temporary platforms, interactive props
- **NPCs:** Enemies, crowds

The pooling concept dramatically improves performance by eliminating the cost of spawning `AActors` and the associated garbage collection spikes, resulting in reduced hiccups and overhead associated with `AActor` usage. 
It is important to note that there are bespoke pooling systems included with different parts of the engine; these should be utilized when available.
