# Tooling

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusTooling" />

Whilst the **Unreal Editor** is an extremely powerful and feature-rich authoring experience for content; there are times, moments where maybe some of the behaviour or features aren’t quite where we would like to see them. 

This plugin attempts to augment the **Unreal Editor** in-our-vision without requiring source changes.
