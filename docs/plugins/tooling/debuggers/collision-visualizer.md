A tool used to quickly test world traces and their responses.

After watching George Prosser's UnrealFest 2023 talk [Collision Data in UE5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIQI6nXFygA) we set about creating our interpretation of the tool with a different method of integration. We later found out about the publicly available [UECollisionQueryTools](https://github.com/StudioGobo/UECollisionQueryTools) repository. Credits to George and the team at Studio Gobo for the great inspiration for this tool.
