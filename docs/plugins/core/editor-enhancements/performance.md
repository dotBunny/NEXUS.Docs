# Performance

Some performance settings we thought should be available, by default.

## Framerate Limit
As our GPUs go **vroooooooom** more and more, the need to limit the editor's framerate becomes more in focus. This feature sets the editor's maximum framerate on start so that you don't have to.

This only occurs when the Unreal Editor is user-controlled.

## Always Show Metrics

A quick toggle to ensure that the Unreal Editor's Performance setting for showing its framerate and memory metrics is on by **default**.

## Settings

The configuration for these features is available in the Editor Preferences under  `NEXUS > Core (User) > Editor Performance`.
