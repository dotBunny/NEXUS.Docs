# Plugins

We do our best to keep the framework split up into bespoke functionality modules/plugins. Allowing for *developer agency* when it comes to choosing what they want to enable/use. The [NCore](/docs/plugins/core/) module is enabled by *default*, as it is a dependency of all other plugins.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusCore" link={true} />

### Systems

Bespoke `UWorldSubsystem`-based systems that have a specific, well-described functionality. These typically provide opinionated systemic solutions to the underlying technical needs of developing games. 

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusActorPools" link={true} />
<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusDynamicReferences" link={true} />

### Helpers

Utility-like collections of functionality which haven't yet grown to system-like status but are equally helpful.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusPicker" link={true} />
<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusMultiplayer" link={true} />

### Content

While **NEXUS** is predominantly about providing code-based solutions to problems, there is still room for some opinionated content.

<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusBlockout" link={true} />
<PluginDetails moduleName="NexusUserInterface" link={true} />

### Editor-Only

Stuff that should never find its way into any cook â€” *ever*.
