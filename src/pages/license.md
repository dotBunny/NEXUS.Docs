# License

The **NEXUS** Framework is available for consumption under the BSL-1.0 license. This license was chosen because it offers users a high degree of flexibility [compared to other open-source licenses](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-boost-software-license/). Many institutional developersâ€™ legal teams prefer this license over the MIT license.
