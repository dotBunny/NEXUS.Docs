On **July 12, 2025**, we pushed the button to make the **NEXUS** Framework public.

The development of the **NEXUS** Framework stems from choices made on a passion project of ours, **Dethol**. One of the pillars of that project is to make as much of the required tech available in an open-source manner. As the project progresses further in its development, more and more will be transitioned to **NEXUS**. We also take input from other developers for ideas or functionality and prioritize those inclusions where applicable.

In the spirit of openness and accountability, we are utilizing a GitHub project to [track our work](https://github.com/orgs/dotBunny/projects/6/views/1) and provide a glimpse into the future [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dotBunny/projects/6/views/2).
